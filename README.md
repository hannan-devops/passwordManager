This is the C++ basic app which i developed as a first semester project for Programming Fundamentals course.
This includes the following functions:

2. Email verification
3. Phone No & CNIC verification
4. Profile delete and recover functionalities
5. Random strong password generator
6. Also tell in how much time your password can be broken (like in milli sec , months or years etc)
7. if you generated a random password which is very string then it is very likely for you to remember it so you also set a pin at time of signup which then you enter at time of login then your password will be autofilled and also it includes user management system, it stores the detail of every user accurately in a file also read and search from the file using c++ file handling
